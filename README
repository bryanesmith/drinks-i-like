===== ABOUT =====

A simple, single-page web application that allows you to create, read, update and delete drinks that you like. Uses Mojolicious::Lite to create a RESTful interface, and Backbone.js to manage the communication between the server and the client.

===== REQUIRED =====

  * MySQL (5.1.62 or greater)
  * Perl (5.10.1 or greater) and the following modules:
    - DBI and DBD::mysql
  * Mojolicious

===== INSTALL =====

1. From your terminal, navigate into the root directory for this project:

  $ cd ~/Sources/drinks-i-like

2. Using the MySQL client, create the database `drinks_i_like`, as well as a user with the same name (take note of the password you use):

  mysql> CREATE DATABASE `drinks_i_like`;
  Query OK, 1 row affected (0.07 sec)


  mysql> GRANT USAGE ON `drinks_i_like`.* TO drinks_i_like@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'mysecretpassword';
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.15 sec)

  mysql>

Note the password you use for this new user; you'll set it in step #5.

3. From the MySQL client, run the SQL script, install/init.sql, to generate the table(s) and sample data.

  mysql> \. install/init.sql
  Database changed
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.09 sec)

  Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

  mysql> 

4. Create a configuration file using the sample, and set the password you used:

  $ cp lib/MyConfig.pm.example lib/MyConfig.pm
  
5. Open this configuration file (lib/MyConfig.pm) and set the password:

  package Config;

  sub db_name     { 'drinks_i_like' }
  sub db_username { 'drinks_i_like' }
  sub db_password { 'mysecretpassword' } # <-- HERE

  1;

===== RUN =====

1. Run bin/server:

  $ bin/server 
  [Wed May 16 10:18:52 2012] [info] Server listening (http://*:3000)
  Server available at http://127.0.0.1:3000.
